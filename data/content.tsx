    q: "Who founded Omelora?",
    a: "Kyra Ezikeuzor, a Nigerian-American high school student in Texas, founded Omelora after recognizing a gap in resources tailored for children in West Africa, particularly in southern Nigeria. While Kyra and her peers had access to books and resources that expanded their futures, many kids in West Africa did not. Although many nonprofits focus on essential needs like aid, food, and water, they often overlook the importance of supporting young imaginations. Omelora aims to bridge this gap by bringing young people from all over, starting in southeast Nigeria, into the global conversation.",
